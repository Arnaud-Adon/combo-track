You're task is now to explore the codebase to understand the following feature : "$ARGUMENTS"

Follow this workflow :

1. Look all the files and identify all relevant files for the features

2. Analysis all the files and define the dependencies they have (library or other files)

3. Use context7 / WebSearch or ReadFile to read this dependencies. If it's node dependencies, use COntext7 to understand them or WebSearch.

## Response

At the end, put everything together to create a clean response with the file path so I can CMD+Click on them. Show the code examples with comments and explanation. Try to keep your response small so I don't get confuse.
