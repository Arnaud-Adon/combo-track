# 🕹️ ComboTrack

**ComboTrack** is a lightweight SaaS app built for competitive fighting game players who want to improve smarter and faster.

It allows you to **take timestamped notes** directly on YouTube videos — whether you're reviewing matches, watching tutorials, or analyzing your gameplay.

## 🔥 Why ComboTrack?

Right now, players use:
- 📝 Paper notebooks (easy to lose or forget)
- 📄 Google Docs or Notion (not synced with video time)
- 🧠 Their memory (not reliable for consistent improvement)

But none of these tools are truly made for:
> ✅ Linking **each note** to a **specific video moment**  
> ✅ **Instantly replaying** important moments  
> ✅ Keeping a clean, searchable history of match notes

**ComboTrack fixes that.**
